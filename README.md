# Web Chat App
Welcome to the repo of [Web Chat](https://webchat.scantlebury.io/) a feature rich chat PWA made the rival the most popular of them out there. Remember to send me a friend request at my username "warren" if you want to have a chat on the app, and turn on push notifications if you have a supported device to know when i respond to your messages.

* get push notifications on supported devices to never miss a message
* personal profile with statuses, profile pics 
* send voicenotes and pictures for a full messaging experience 
* share pictures to the application just like a native app 
* friend requests to ensure only people you want to chat with can send you a message
* message statuses show when your message is sent, received and read and you can also see when your friend is typing
* watch YouTube videos with friends, syncing playback and actions like pause and play
